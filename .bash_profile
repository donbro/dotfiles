#   functions
#

#  [ function ] name () compound-command [redirection]
#      This defines a function named name.  The reserved word function is optional.  If the  function
#      reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional.  The body of the function is the com-
#      pound command compound-command (see Compound Commands above).  That command is usually a  list
#      of  commands  between  {  and  }, but may be any command listed under Compound Commands above.
#      compound-command is executed whenever name is specified as the name of a simple command.   Any
#      redirections  (see  REDIRECTION below) specified when a function is defined are performed when
#      the function is executed.  The exit status of a function definition is zero  unless  a  syntax
#      error  occurs  or  a  readonly function with the same name already exists.  When executed, the
#      exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the  body.   (See
#      FUNCTIONS below.)
